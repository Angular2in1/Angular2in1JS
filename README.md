## Angular2in1

Angular2in1 is an effort to use Angular2 in AngularJS


Today all the world is moving toward Angular2 leaving behind all the effort we done on AngularJS.

As we know Angular2 is TypeScript and AngularJS is Javascript. So there is long clash because of language, tools, architecture and many more reasons. 

Migrating is not always viable for small players and in some case enterprise's who are running short on funds.

So what is the crux... Have we lost it ??? or is there still a ray of hope shining from somewhere...

Keeping all these questions and few idea's and tricks in mind, we are putting our best effort to use Angular2 power in existing AngularJS artificats.

Let hope for the best :)
